# GitHub Actions Debugger

This project demonstrates the [https://github.com/dlemstra/github-actions-debugger](https://github.com/dlemstra/github-actions-debugger) project that be used to debug a GitHub Action on a hosted runner. This project contains a demo for `ubuntu`, `macos` and `windows`. To view how this works go to the `github-actions-debugger` project and start a GitHub Codespace. Then start one of the actions you must first create a fork of this repository and a secret call `TOKEN_FOR_CODESPACES` and set it to a personal access token that can access codespaces. When starting the action the name of the codespace is required as an input field.
